                        <strong>1. Nutrition</strong><br />
                        <strong>Cats:</strong><br />
                        Cats require a diet based on animal protein, such as meat and poultry. Offer dry or wet food specifically made for cats, ensuring a variety of food sources. Avoid giving milk to adult cats, as it may cause digestive issues. Ensure fresh, clean water is always available.<br /><br />
                        
                        <strong>Dogs:</strong><br />
                        Dogs need a balanced diet containing protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Offer dry or wet food based on the dog's age and weight. Avoid giving chocolate, grapes, and onions to dogs as they are toxic. Provide clean water regularly, especially during hot weather or after physical activity.<br /><br />

                        <strong>Rabbits:</strong><br />
                        Rabbits need a fiber-rich diet, including hay and fresh vegetables. Avoid sugary or starchy foods like bread and cereals. Ensure fresh water is always available.<br /><br />

                        <strong>Birds:</strong><br />
                        Birds need a varied diet that includes seeds, fresh fruits, and vegetables. Avoid giving fatty or salty foods like chips. Provide clean water, and change it regularly.<br /><br />

                        <strong>Fish:</strong><br />
                        Fish require a specific diet depending on their type (ornamental, tropical, or marine). Avoid overfeeding fish, as this can pollute the water. Ensure a varied diet for fish, including pellets and flakes.<br /><br />

                        <strong>Hamsters and other rodents:</strong><br />
                        Rodents need a balanced diet that includes fruits, vegetables, and seeds. Providing hay and straw is important for healthy digestion.<br /><br />

                        <strong>2. Cage Cleaning and Environment</strong><br />
                        <strong>Cats:</strong><br />
                        The litter box should be cleaned daily to avoid bad odors, and the litter should be changed regularly. Clean the cat's sleeping area and wash bedding frequently. Toys and feeding areas can be cleaned with mild soap and water.<br /><br />

                        <strong>Dogs:</strong><br />
                        Clean the dog's sleeping area once a week, and change and wash the bedding regularly. Keep food and water bowls clean, washing them with soap and water. If the dog uses a crate for sleeping or resting, it should be cleaned and sanitized regularly.<br /><br />

                        <strong>Rabbits:</strong><br />
                        Clean the cage weekly and change the hay periodically to maintain a clean and healthy environment. Regularly clean food and water dishes to avoid bacteria buildup.<br /><br />

                        <strong>Birds:</strong><br />
                        Cages should be cleaned regularly, and food and water should be changed daily. Providing a small bath for birds helps them maintain personal hygiene.<br /><br />

                        <strong>Hamsters and other rodents:</strong><br />
                        Cages should be cleaned weekly, with bedding changed regularly. Ensure food and water dishes are kept clean daily.<br /><br />

                        <strong>3. Importance of a Suitable Environment</strong><br />
                        <strong>Cats:</strong><br />
                        Cats love exploring high places, so providing a climbing tower or indoor shelves encourages movement. The ideal environment for cats should include stimulating toys like cotton balls and scratching posts to maintain their mental and physical health. Providing quiet, secluded areas for hiding and resting is essential for keeping the cat comfortable.<br /><br />

                        <strong>Dogs:</strong><br />
                        Dogs need ample space for movement and play, especially active breeds. Stimulating toys like balls and chewables can help provide physical activity. Ensure a safe and comfortable environment for sleep and rest, away from noise or disturbance.<br /><br />

                        <strong>Rabbits:</strong><br />
                        Rabbits need plenty of space to move inside the cage, with the option to access an area for exercise outside the cage. Providing toys and chewable items helps maintain the health of rabbits' teeth.<br /><br />

                        <strong>Birds:</strong><br />
                        Birds need a spacious cage with the ability to fly or move freely inside it. Providing toys like mirrors and bells helps keep birds entertained and happy.<br /><br />

                        <strong>Fish:</strong><br />
                        Fish tanks should be equipped with filters and sufficient oxygen to maintain clean water and the health of the fish. Adding plants or decorations to the tank provides a natural environment for fish and reduces stress.<br /><br />

                        <strong>Hamsters and other rodents:</strong><br />
                        The cage should be spacious and include a running wheel and tunnels for activity. Rodents enjoy mentally stimulating toys such as small balls and natural chews.
